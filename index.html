            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="left"> <!-- 6. PSUEDO-CLASS => SEE CSS -->
              <h3>Education</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Associate's degree in Computer Science from Rowan-Cabarrus Community College</li>
                <li>Current student at Thinkful for software engineering</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>My Story</h3>
              <p>After I graduated from college, I ended up getting into the food industry as a cook. I enjoy cooking and making others happy with the food I prepare for them.</p>
              <p>I also picked up the hobby of DJing. I love music, and this gives me the opportunity to bring that passion to others. Seeing people move and dance to the music I'm playing brings me joy as well.</p>
              <p>The pattern here is that I enjoy experiencing and bringing things to others that they have a passion for as well. Coding allows for this too. I am able to experience the art of coding with fellow developers, while also bringing the joy of the results to others.</p>
              <p>If you'd like to hire or work with a new (and developing) developer, feel free to contact me...</p>
